# Predicting Arrest by the NYPD
With 2018 stop, question, and frisk data provided by the New York Police Department, I used three machine learning models to predict whether being stopped by an NYPD officer would result in an arrest. As the models are not intended to determine legitimacy or justness of either the arrests or the stops, features that may play on an officerâ€™s engrained biases or stereotypes were included.<br><br>Of the three models, the random forest one performed the best, registering 90% accuracy and 2.6% false positives.
